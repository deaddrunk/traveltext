# SimpleMMO TravelText

SimpleMMO TravelText is a web browser extension that allows you to edit the travel text and much more displayed while stepping in the web version of SimpleMMO.

# Installation

## Before installing

Most browsers like Firefox support directly installing the extension within the browser, meaning you can just click on firefox-signed.xpi if you're on Firefox while on the [Releases](https://github.com/alexanderdavidj/traveltext/releases/) page. When this is not the case, you can follow the instructions below.

#### Firefox

After downloading either firefox-signed.xpi or firefox-unsigned.xpi, go to the corresponding installation instructions for a Firefox Extension

-   [Ways to Install Firefox Extensions](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Firefox-Extensions) (2nd method)

#### Chrome

After downloading chrome.zip from the latest release or cloning the repository, head to the installation instructions for a Chrome extension
